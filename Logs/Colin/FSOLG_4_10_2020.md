# FSOLG 4/10/2020
## Time 11.5 Hours

### Notes
4/10 commit is a full local commit of the CLI including tests and docs. The time is representative of multiple days of work.

CLI is complete outside of integration with the other components and the ensuing integration testing.

Usability testing can be done without the integration, and I have begun to do this in a limited capacity with family members.
