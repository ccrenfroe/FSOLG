Researching new methods to gather data. data.nba.net looked ok at first, but it won't work because I don't see a way to get historical data. I can get to the today.json page and all of the links associated with it, but none of them seem to be able to point to historical data to the specific scale I want. I can get past season stats for example, but not their box scores for the individual games. I don't know if any other sources can, but I am hopeful. I will most likely be moving on to web scrapping stats.nba.com, although it may be a bit messier using requests and BeautifulSoup together. I also made 2 reddit posts, asking the analytic community on NBA Analytics and sportsanalytics if there are any sources they would recommend besides the ones I have found so far. Maybe that will give me some good results?
