## Notes
NO considerable progress. Tried using selenium to dynamically web scrape but it is way too slow for how much scrapping we want to do. Also tried to use pandas *read_html* method for stats.nba.com, but it doesn't recognize the tables on stats.nba.com. Works on basketball-reference though. Web scraping is getting much more sloppy and difficult without the APIs, and also slower.
