## Notes
Lots of good progress with Selenium. Finished with the CSV initializing. Also got all of the links I need to get to all of the players on each teams roster. Tomorrow should be able to quickly do the inits for each player, and then move on to scraping data for each player. First, will do the inits for the players, and then make them scrape back over a whole years worth of data so that we can have some data for our ML algorithms to train on. After that I'll refine it to scrape 'x' amount of days back.
