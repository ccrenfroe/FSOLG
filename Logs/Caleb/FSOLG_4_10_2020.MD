4 hours
## Notes
Good progress. The program can now initialize all of the CSVs for each team and player. Next, need to just scrape a year or so worth of data to start working on the machine learning part. I can later implement scraping x amount of days instead. This should be completed tomorrow morning, and I don't see it being too difficult at all, simply going to the correct webpage and using pandas to read in the table of all of the games for a given year.
