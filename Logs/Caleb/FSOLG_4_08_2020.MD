## Notes
Spent alot of time just thinking on the next approach to take. Was falling behind but I feel confident in the new approach we are takine. Opted to go for Selenium to scrape because we really needed the data in the dynamic tables on basketball-reference. I was hesitant, but feeling better after using Chromedriver as the driver instead of geckodriver (firefox). It seems to be running at speedsa equivalent to what we had before.

Also talked with Dr.Olsen to give her an update on my plans. She agreed with my thinking and emphasized to just focus on trying to get the data read in right now so that we can have something to train on. The Running time itself is'nt as important. I agree since our clients didn't seem too picky about the scrapping time either.
