## Time
3 1/2 hours
## Notes
Implemented the scraper to be able to scrape through X amount of games. Also added experience as a row in the CSVs. Debugged the code to be able to work with the new experience category and cleared up some old commented out code. Need to quickly add a position row tomorrow morning to add the final touch to the CSVs so that the scraper will be fully functional and ready to be tested by users.
