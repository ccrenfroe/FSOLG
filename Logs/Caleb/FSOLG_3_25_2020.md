### Notes
WHEN DONE WITH WEB SCRAPPING - If they want, will send it over to Dave and Dn. Im sure DOn may find it useful already.
In addition, HIGHLY encourgage them to look at the traditional and advanced box scores for players and teams under the quicklinks ondata.nba.com. There are so many stats we can take and a variety of data to include. I really need them to look into what they want specificaly or find crucial, keeping in mind alot of the data may still be dropped later on with the ML if it is found to be nonimportant and fluffy.


Worked on reasoning through how I want to navigate through the webpages and wrote down the pseudocode template for the team scrapping. SPlit into 2 parts; "initializing" the team CSVs for the case where its a brand new season or the user is just starting the season, etc., and the other part to scrape back to a user given "x" amount of days.

Tomorrow will be trying to implement the first part.
