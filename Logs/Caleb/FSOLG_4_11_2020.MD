Implemented a file structure as well as scraping for a years worth of data. Got a solid amount of code donea nd accomplished the task that was set out for the day as well as setting up the programs data directory structure, which took a bit of extra time but turned out to be pretty simple. Still need to extend its functionality to be able to scrape X amount of data. However, now we are finally able to start on the machine learning part with all of the data scraped.
