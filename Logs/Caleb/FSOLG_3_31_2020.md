Tried to get the API to work with the players. Attempted to make API-NBA work for retrieving all of the players and building rosters for each team in the NBA, but it ended up being busted. It would build the rosters with players on the team but also players who were previously on the team, giving me inaccurate data. Need to start over now, but found a new API that looks promising.

[New API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) - This looks more promising and hopefully will work well. It seems more accurate when comparing the results it gets in the examples to the actual json data at data.nba.com. 

If this doesn't work, I will resort to either scrapping the box scores on nba.com itself, or using the data.nba.net API. I lean towards scrapping first though because the API for the NBA is not very appealing to me.
