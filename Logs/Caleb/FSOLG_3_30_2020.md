## Time
1 1/2ish of work done today

### Notes
Finished the Init function for the Team CSVs. Was quick and easy. Also messed around with thinking through what requirements we want to accomplish soon and wrote them out. The API has been useful and I believe we will continue to use it.

Tomorrow will brainstorm what data to add to the Team CSVs and doing the player inits.
