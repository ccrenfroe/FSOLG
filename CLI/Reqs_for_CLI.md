#### Instructions for Compilation

The CLI can be simply ran in the Terminal within its contained domain and specifying "python CLI.py ..." as long as python 3.8
is installed locally. The following steps should allow for running the CLI.

- Installation of python 3.8 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- In terminal with python 3.8 set as the default version: 
    - "pip install click pyfiglet funcy"
- Congrats! The CLI will run!

#### Instructions for Running

- CD into the repo in which CLI.py is contained
- Enter "CLI.py [OPTIONAL FLAGS]" in the console and hit enter!

## TODO
*Integrate CLI with web scraper and machine learning components
*Usability tests to determine quality of interaction with CLI
*Evaluation from customers to determine if CLI matches their expectations (CLI affords rapid changes)
