#### Windows

Running the FSOLG system on windows requires installation of Python 3.8 and UNIX compatibilities

#### MacOS/Linux

The CLI can be simply ran in the Terminal within its contained domain and specifying "python CLI.py ..." as long as python 3.8
is installed locally

## TODO
*Integrate CLI with web scraper and machine learning components
*Usability tests to determine quality of interaction with CLI
*Evaluation from customers to determine if CLI matches their expectations (CLI affords rapid changes)
