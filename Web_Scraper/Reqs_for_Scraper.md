## Webdriver
In order for Selenium to work, it needs a webdriver. The driver depends on the browser you want to use, and are referenced to by the Selenium docs [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers). **Make sure to add it to your PATH.**

Path can be found by going to the *Control Panel*, then searching for *environmental variables*.

In the terminal, use the command echo $PATH
